# SNOWASCII (Winter-themed ASCII Shooter Game)

## Description

SNOWASCII is a simple 2D game developed using GameMaker, featuring a winter theme with ASCII characters. In this fast-paced game, you control an ASCII character represented by 'P', shooting at enemy ASCII characters represented by 'S'. The primary goal is to achieve the highest score possible before your health reaches zero or the 60-second timer runs out.

## Gameplay Features

- **Player Control**: You play as the ASCII character 'P', navigating and shooting enemies using the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys, with the mouse to point and shoot.

- **Enemies**: Encounter various types of enemy ASCII characters ('S') with different speeds and damage outputs, which constantly follow you around the screen.

- **Health System**: A visual health bar displayed above the player's character indicates current health status.

- **Timer**: The game lasts for 60 seconds, and once there are just 10 seconds left on the timer, a swarm of fast 'S' characters appears to heighten the challenge.

- **Screens**: 
  - **Welcome Screen**: Displays game instructions and welcomes players to the game.
  - **Death Screen**: Shows the final score and prompts players for a restart or exit.
